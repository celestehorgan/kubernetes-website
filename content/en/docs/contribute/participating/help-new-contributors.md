## Serve as a New Contributor Ambassador

SIG Docs [approvers](/docs/contribute/participating/#approvers) can serve as
New Contributor Ambassadors.

New Contributor Ambassadors welcome new contributors to SIG-Docs,
suggest PRs to new contributors, and mentor new contributors through their first
few PR submissions.

Responsibilities for New Contributor Ambassadors include:

- Monitoring the [#sig-docs Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com) for questions from new contributors.
- Working with PR wranglers to identify good first issues for new contributors.
- Mentoring new contributors through their first few PRs to the docs repo.
- Helping new contributors create the more complex PRs they need to become Kubernetes members.
- [Sponsoring contributors](/docs/contribute/advanced/#sponsor-a-new-contributor) on their path to becoming Kubernetes members.

Current New Contributor Ambassadors are announced at each SIG-Docs meeting, and in the [Kubernetes #sig-docs channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com).

## Sponsor a new contributor

SIG Docs [reviewers](/docs/contribute/participating/#reviewers) can sponsor
new contributors.

After a new contributor has successfully submitted 5 substantive pull requests
to one or more Kubernetes repositories, they are eligible to apply for
[membership](/docs/contribute/participating#members) in the Kubernetes
organization. The contributor's membership needs to be backed by two sponsors
who are already reviewers.

New docs contributors can request sponsors by asking in the #sig-docs channel
on the [Kubernetes Slack instance](https://kubernetes.slack.com) or on the
[SIG Docs mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs).
If you feel confident about the applicant's work, you volunteer to sponsor them.
When they submit their membership application, reply to the application with a
"+1" and include details about why you think the applicant is a good fit for
membership in the Kubernetes organization.
