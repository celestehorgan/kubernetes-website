## Serve as a SIG Co-chair

SIG Docs [approvers](/docs/contribute/participating/#approvers) can serve a term as a co-chair of SIG Docs.

### Prerequisites

Approvers must meet the following requirements to be a co-chair:

- Have been a SIG Docs approver for at least 6 months
- Have [led a Kubernetes docs release](/docs/contribute/advanced/#coordinate-docs-for-a-kubernetes-release) or shadowed two releases
- Understand SIG Docs workflows and tooling: git, Hugo, localization, blog subproject
- Understand how other Kubernetes SIGs and repositories affect the SIG Docs workflow, including: [teams in k/org](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/blob/master/config/kubernetes/sig-docs/teams.yaml), [process in k/community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs), plugins in [k/test-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/), and the role of [SIG Architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture).
- Commit at least 5 hours per week (and often more) to the role for a minimum of 6 months

### Responsibilities

The role of co-chair is one of service: co-chairs build contributor capacity, handle process and policy, schedule and run meetings, schedule PR wranglers, advocate for docs in the Kubernetes community, make sure that docs succeed in Kubernetes release cycles, and keep SIG Docs focused on effective priorities.

Responsibilities include:

- Make room for different discussion styles while keeping the discussion focused and honoring folks' time

**Honor folks' time**:

Begin and end meetings on time.

**Use Zoom effectively**:
