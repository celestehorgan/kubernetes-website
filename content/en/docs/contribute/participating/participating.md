<!-- overview -->

SIG Docs is one of the
[special interest groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md)
within the Kubernetes project, focused on writing, updating, and maintaining
the documentation for Kubernetes as a whole. See
[SIG Docs from the community github repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs)
for more information about the SIG.

SIG Docs welcomes content and reviews from all contributors. Anyone can open a
pull request (PR), and anyone is welcome to file issues about content or comment
on pull requests in progress.

You can also become a [member](#members),
[reviewer](#reviewers), or [approver](#approvers). These roles require greater
access and entail certain responsibilities for approving and committing changes.
See [community-membership](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md)
for more information on how membership works within the Kubernetes community.

The rest of this document outlines some unique ways these roles function within
SIG Docs, which is responsible for maintaining one of the most public-facing
aspects of Kubernetes -- the Kubernetes website and documentation.
