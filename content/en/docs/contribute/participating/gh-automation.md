## SIG Docs teams and automation

Automation in SIG Docs relies on two different mechanisms for automation:
GitHub groups and OWNERS files.

### GitHub groups

The SIG Docs group defines two teams on GitHub:

 - [@kubernetes/sig-docs-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/sig-docs-maintainers)
 - [@kubernetes/sig-docs-pr-reviews](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/sig-docs-pr-reviews)

Each can be referenced with their `@name` in GitHub comments to communicate with
everyone in that group.

These teams overlap, but do not exactly match, the groups used by the automation
tooling. For assignment of issues, pull requests, and to support PR approvals,
the automation uses information from OWNERS files.

### OWNERS files and front-matter

The Kubernetes project uses an automation tool called prow for automation
related to GitHub issues and pull requests. The
[Kubernetes website repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) uses
two [prow plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/plugins):

- blunderbuss
- approve

These two plugins use the
[OWNERS](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/OWNERS) and
[OWNERS_ALIASES](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/OWNERS_ALIASES)
files in the top level of the `kubernetes/website` GitHub repository to control
how prow works within the repository.

An OWNERS file contains a list of people who are SIG Docs reviewers and
approvers. OWNERS files can also exist in subdirectories, and can override who
can act as a reviewer or approver of files in that subdirectory and its
descendents. For more information about OWNERS files in general, see
[OWNERS](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/owners.md).

In addition, an individual Markdown file can list reviewers and approvers in its
front-matter, either by listing individual GitHub usernames or GitHub groups.

The combination of OWNERS files and front-matter in Markdown files determines
the advice PR owners get from automated systems about who to ask for technical
and editorial review of their PR.

## How merging works

When a pull request is merged to the branch used to publish content (currently
`master`), that content is published and available to the world. To ensure that
the quality of our published content is high, we limit merging pull requests to
SIG Docs approvers. Here's how it works.

- When a pull request has both the `lgtm` and `approve` labels, has no `hold`
  labels, and all tests are passing, the pull request merges automatically.
- Kubernetes organization members and SIG Docs approvers can add comments to
  prevent automatic merging of a given pull request (by adding a `/hold` comment
  or withholding a `/lgtm` comment).
- Any Kubernetes member can add the `lgtm` label by adding a `/lgtm` comment.
- Only SIG Docs approvers can merge a pull request
  by adding an `/approve` comment. Some approvers also perform additional
  specific roles, such as [PR Wrangler](/docs/contribute/advanced#be-the-pr-wrangler-for-a-week) or
  [SIG Docs chairperson](#sig-docs-chairperson).
